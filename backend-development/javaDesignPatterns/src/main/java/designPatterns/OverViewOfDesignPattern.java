    /* OVERVIEW OF DESIGN PATTERNS */
    /* 1.Introduction */
    /* A.Design Patterns Represent the best practices used by experienced Object-Oriented Software Developers. */
    /* B.Design Patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. */
    /* C.These solutions were obtained by trail and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time. */

    /* Special Characteristics of Design Pattern- */
    /* 1.Smart: - They are elegant Solutions that a novice would not think of immediately. Simple Solution to new Software Developers. */
    /* 2.Generic: - They are not normally dependent on a specific system type, programming languages or application domains. They are generic in nature. */
    /* 3.Well-Proven: - They Have been identified from real, Object-Oriented Systems. They are not result or simple paper work, but they have been successfully tested in several systems. */
    /* 4.Simple: - They are usually quit small, involving small number of classes. The complex systems are built using different design patterns and their combinations. */
    /* 5.Reusable: - They are documented in such a manner to increase reusability. */
    /* 6.Object-Oriented: - They are built with the basic Object-Oriented mechanisms such as classes, objects, generalization and polymorphism. */
