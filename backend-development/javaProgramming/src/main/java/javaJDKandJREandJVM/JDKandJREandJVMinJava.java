    /* 2.What is JRE? What it contains? */
    /*A.JRE -> Java RunTime Environment. */
    /*B.JRE Contains Libraries and Java Internal Classes. */

    /*A.JVM -> Java Virtual Machine. */
    /*B.JVM Contains Class Loader Sub System, Memory Area OR RunTime Data Areas, Execution Engine and Native Libraries. */
    /*C.JVM Contains Machine Understandable Code / Interpreted ByteCode. */
    /* 4.Which can be Installed explicitly in a system? */
    /*A.We can Install JVM Explicitly in our System. */
    /*B.Up to Java 8 Version We can Install JDK and JRE Individually, After that we can not install Individually. */

    /*A.JVM Architecture Contains 1.Class Loader SubSystem, 2.RunTime Data Areas, 3.Execution Engine. */
    /*B.Class Loader SubSystem Have Three Phases 1.Loading, 2.Linking, 3.Initialization. */
    /*C.1.Again Loading Hava Three Phases 1.Bootstrap Class Loader, 2.Extension Class , 3.Application Class Loader. */
    /*1.Boostrap Class Loader is Responsible for Archy.Jar OR Classes From Archy.jar in Java. */
    /*2.Extension Class Loader is Responsible OR This Class Will Load Classes Present in .ext Folder in Lib Folder. */
    /*3.Application Class Loader is Responsible Or This Class Will Load External Library Class File. */
    /*4.This Three Classes Will Load the Class Files From Different Places. */
    /*D.2.Again Linking Have Three Phases 1.Verify, 2.Prepare, 3.Resolve. */
    /*1.Verify is Responsible For OR Verify the Byte Code in Java Class. */
    /*2.In Prepare Phase if Any Static Variables is Used in Java Class, Default Values Will Initialize in This Phase. */
    /*3.Resolve in this Phase Symbolic References are Replaced With Method References and Set in RunTime Constant Pool. */
    /*E.3.Initialization Hava Only one Phase 1.initialization. */
    /*1.Initialization phase origin values will assign to static variables. */
    /*3.Execution Engine have Three Phases 1.Interpreter, 2.JIT Compiler, 3.Garbage Collector. */
    /*1.Interpreter Will Read Line by Line and Convert Byte Code in to Binary Language With Help Of Native Method Interface and Native Method Library. */
    /*2.JIT Compiler Will Help to Interpreter to Increase the Performance and Avoiding Reading Duplicate Code While Interpretation. */
    /*3.3.Garbage Collector will Remove Unwanted Code From Java Code. */
