    /*A.Iterator is an Interface in Java.*/
    /*B.This will Help for the Iterate the Data OR Objects From Collections.*/

    /*2.What is a ListIterator? Why do we need it?*/
    /*A.ListIterator is an Interface in Java.*/
    /*B.This will Help for the Iterate the Data OR Objects From Collections.*/

    /*3.What is en Enumeration? Why do we need it?*/
    /*A.Enumeration is an Interface in Java.*/
    /*B.This will Help for the Iterate the Data OR Objects From Collections.*/
    /*C.Introduced For Iterating the Legacy Collection Objects.*/
    /*D.Legacy Classes Means Which Classes are Introduced in Java Version 1.0 That Classes Called as Legacy Classes in Java.*/
    /*E.Legacy Classes Example: HashTable, Vector, Dictionary and Properties.*/
    /*F.After Java Version 1.2 Classes called as New Classes.*/
    /*G.New Classes Example: ArrayList, HashMap.*/
    /*H.We Will Use Enumeration To Iterate Legacy Classes and Enumeration is Also Legacy Interface.*/
    /*I.Enumeration Has Mainly Two Methods 1.hasMoreElements() and 2.nextElement().*/
    /*J.1.hasMoreElements(): To Verify the Next Element in The Collection to Iterate.*/
    /*K.2.nextElement(): To Access The Elements From Collection.*/
    /*L.This Interface is Read Only, We Access only one Direction that Forward Direction, We Cannot Access from Reverse Direction.*/
    /*M.We Can Not Perform Other Operations Like Update, Delete, Only We Can Access From Collection.*/
